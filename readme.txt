Redirects logged in user from home to profile, plus adds post/page privacy.

== Description ==

This plugin adds two settings in Dashboard/Settings/Reading.
The first setting if checked will redirect a logged in user
to their profile. 

The second setting if checked will prevent
all logged out visitors from viewing all WP/BP/bbPress posts
and pages with exception of the home page. Once logged out 
the user is redirected back to the home page. When logged
out all attempts at viewing anything other than the home
page results in the visitor being redirected back to the
home page.
 
If both of these settings are checked then all WP/BP/bbPress 
posts and pages will be private with the exception of the 
home page. Once logged in the user will be redirected to
their profile and after they are logged out they will be
redirected back to the home page. When logged out all 
attempts at viewing anything other than the home page 
results in the visitor being redirected back to the home 
page.

This plugin has not been tested with multi-site installations.

== Installation ==

Install via the WordPress plugin installer and activate, or do a manual upload.
Go to Dashboard/Settings/Reading and check the box beside "Redirect Home Page 
To Profile On Login?".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: I added "Home" to my custom menu and when logged in if I click it, 
it redirects me to my profile. How can I stop this?

A: The best thing to do is not add "Home" to your custom menu as it will
help avoid confusion by your users.
